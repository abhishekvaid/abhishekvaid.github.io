A former entrepreneur who is extremely passionate about Technology, Software and Business. I'm
currently working as a Technical Architect / Engineering Manager at Urban Company, Gurgram, India,
where I contribute to consumer growth vertical by designing, architecting, optimizing and maintaining
software frameworks and allied implementations. I also manage a very high output team of Senior and
Junior Developers in Growth Engineering vertical. Before this, I was a Co-Founder and CTO at Frrole
AI | A Bangalore based startup and an AI platform that analyzes large scale social data streams
to power interesting consumer intelligence use-cases. I have adequate hands-on experience and
deep interest in disciplines like Large scale Software Implementations, Machine Learning, Data
Science and design/implementation of Data driven Platforms. Before Frrole, I was engaged in
various teaching positions, contributed to multiple academic projects and have published few research papers. I am a strong advocate of continuous self-driven growth and therefore an active participant on leading self- learning platforms like edX, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, DataCamp and rest. On average, I spend anywhere between 10 to 15 hours per week on these platforms to learn new technologies.
