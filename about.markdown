Hi, My name is Abhishek Vaid

I live by these **4** core tenets of Success:
  - **Focus** - To apply very high levels of concentration to work at hand and free yourself from all distractions.
  - **Discipline**  - To regularly engage in a well defined, well thought out routine. 
  - **Patience** - To not expect rewards and outcomes to emerge before their due time. 
  - **Tenacity** - To engage in an Activity/Goal with extended levels of committment and passion. 

I am a former entrepreneur who is extremely passionate about Technology, Software and Startups. I'm currently working as **Principal Engineer** at [prophecy.io](http://prophecy.io). 

In the past I've worked as **Engineering Manager/Technical Architect** at [urbancompany.com](http://urbancompany.com) and as **Technology Co-Founder** at [frrole.ai](http://frrole.ai)

I have adequate hands-on experience and
deep interest in disciplines like Large scale Software Implementations, Machine Learning, Data
Science and design/implementation of Data driven Platforms. Before Frrole, I was engaged in
various teaching positions, contributed to multiple academic projects and have published few research papers. I am a strong advocate of continuous self-driven growth and therefore an active participant on leading self- learning platforms like edX, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, DataCamp and rest. On average, I spend anywhere between 10 to 15 hours per week on these platforms to learn new technologies.
